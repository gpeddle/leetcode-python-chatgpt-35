# Zigzag Conversion

To solve the "Zigzag Conversion" problem, you can simulate the zigzag pattern by traversing the input string and organizing the characters into rows. Here's an implementation of the `convert` method:

```python
class Solution:
    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:
        if numRows == 1 or numRows >= len(s):
            return s

        rows = [""] * numRows
        direction = 1  # 1 for moving down, -1 for moving up
        row = 0

        for char in s:
            rows[row] += char

            if row == 0:
                direction = 1
            elif row == numRows - 1:
                direction = -1

            row += direction

        return "".join(rows)
```

This code organizes the characters from the input string `s` into rows following the zigzag pattern. It then concatenates the characters row by row to form the final converted string. You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `convert` method with your input string and the number of rows to obtain the zigzag conversion.
