PROBLEM:
```markdown
# palindromeNumber

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.


## Example 1:

Input: x = 121

Output: true

Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

## Example 2:

Input: x = -121

Output: false

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

## Example 3:

Input: x = 10

Output: false

Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

 
## Constraints:

    -231 <= x <= 231 - 1

 
Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

lass Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        pass
```
