PROBLEM:

# lengthOfLongestSubstring

Given a string s, find the length of the longest
substring
without repeating characters.

 
## Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"

Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

## Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"

Output: 1

Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

## Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"

Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
###ZZ
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

 

## Constraints:

    0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
    s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

```

SKELETON:

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        pass
