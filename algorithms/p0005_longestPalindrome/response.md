# longestPalindrome

To solve the "longestPalindrome" problem, you can use dynamic programming. Here's an implementation of the `longestPalindrome` method:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        if not s:
            return ""

        n = len(s)
        start = 0
        max_len = 1
        dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]

        # All individual characters are palindromes of length 1.
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = True

        # Check for palindromes of length 2.
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                dp[i][i + 1] = True
                start = i
                max_len = 2

        # Check for palindromes of length greater than 2.
        for length in range(3, n + 1):
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1

                if dp[i + 1][j - 1] and s[i] == s[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = True
                    if length > max_len:
                        start = i
                        max_len = length

        return s[start:start + max_len]
```

This code uses dynamic programming to find the longest palindromic substring in the input string `s`. It maintains a 2D table `dp` to keep track of palindromes of various lengths. You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `longestPalindrome` method to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.
