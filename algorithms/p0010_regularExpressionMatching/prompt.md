PROBLEM:

# regularExpressionMatching

Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

    '.' Matches any single character.​​​​
    '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

 
## Example 1:

Input: s = "aa", p = "a"

Output: false

Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

## Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"

Output: true

Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".

## Example 3:

Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"

Output: true

Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".

 
## Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 20
    1 <= p.length <= 20
    s contains only lowercase English letters.
    p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
    It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a previous valid character to match.

## Result

    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        pass
