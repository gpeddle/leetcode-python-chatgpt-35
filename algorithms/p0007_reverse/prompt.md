# Reverse Integer [Medium]

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).


## Example 1:

Input: x = 123

Output: 321

## Example 2:

Input: x = -123

Output: -321

## Example 3:

Input: x = 120

Output: 21

 

## Constraints:

    -231 <= x <= 231 - 1



```

SKELETON:
```python3
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        pass
```
